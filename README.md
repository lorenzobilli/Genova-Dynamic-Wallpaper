## Installation instructions

#### Windows:

- Download and install WinDynamicDesktop ([t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop: Port of macOS Mojave Dynamic Desktop feature to Windows 10 (github.com)](https://github.com/t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop/tree/master)) from the Microsoft Store or from the above link if you're running Windows 8.1 and earlier

- Download the wallpaper (Genova.ddw) from the release page of this repository

- Double click the downloaded file to open and import it inside WinDynamicDesktop

- Set the newly imported "Genova" wallpaper as your wallpaper from within WinDynamicDesktop

#### macOS:

- Due to some bugs in macOS' dynamic wallpaper engine, it is recommended to:
  
  - Remove all the currently opened virtual desktops (i.e. just keep the default "Desktop 1" desktop)
  - Restart the Mac both after setting the default wallpaper (see below) and after setting this new wallpaper.

- Set one of the default macOS wallpaper as your default wallpaper. Make sure you select an actual dynamic wallpaper, NOT just a light/dark one. Also make sure that you choose the "dynamic" option from the wallpaper settings

- Download the wallpaper (Genova.heic) from the release page of this repository

- Right click on the newly downloaded wallpaper, then click on Services -> Set image as wallpaper
